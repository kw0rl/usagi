I know you're missing me right now.

I want you to know that I'm missing you too. Every moment we're apart, you're on my mind.

Close your eyes for a second. Take a deep breath. Imagine I'm right there beside you. I'm holding you close.

Distance doesn't change how I feel. No matter how far apart we are, you're always with me.

I love you. Genuinely, completely.

Always,

I can tell today's been tough. I want you to remember that this heaviness won't last forever. Even when it feels like it will, things do get better.

You're stronger than you give yourself credit for, especially on the days when you don't feel strong at all. I believe in you completely.

I want you to remember:

• You make my days brighter
• Your kindness is something rare
• You deserve every bit of happiness that comes your way

If you need to cry, let it out. There's no shame in that. I'm here, always.

Take your time. I'm not going anywhere.

Love,

I know how frustrating it can be when sleep won't come. Here's what I want you to try:

1. Put your phone down after reading this
2. Get some water if you haven't already
3. Pull the covers up and close your eyes
4. Picture us lying next to each other. I'm gently hugging you.

Take a slow, deep breath. Let your shoulders relax.

Everything's going to be okay.

Dream about the good things. Dream about our future together, all the places we'll go, all the moments we'll share.

Rest well, love.

Goodnight,

You can do this. I know you can. I know this because I know you.

Remember:

• You've overcome difficult things before
• You're more capable than you realize
• One step at a time, that's all you need

Don't compare your journey to anyone else's. Your pace is your own, and that's exactly as it should be.

No matter what happens, I'm proud of you. The fact that you're trying, that you're putting in the effort - that's what matters.

You've got this. I believe in you completely.

Your biggest supporter,

Here are some things I hope will make you smile:

• Remember the first time we met? I was so nervous I could barely speak properly
• Your laugh is honestly one of my favorite sounds
• You're my favorite person. That's just a fact.

I mean it when I say you make everything better. Even the mundane stuff feels different when you're around.

Are you smiling yet? Even just a little?

If not, read this again. I'll wait.

Love you,

I know sometimes feelings can be overwhelming. Sometimes doubts creep in. That's okay, it's human.

But I need you to know something:

I don't love you because you're perfect. I love you because you're you. All your quirks, your flaws, everything that makes you who you are.

I choose you. Every single day, I choose you. And I'll keep choosing you.

There's no one else I'd rather be with. No one else I'd rather share my life with.

You're my person.

Don't doubt this, okay? I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.

Always yours,

Another year with you, and honestly? It just keeps getting better.

Thank you for:

• Being my best friend
• Being my partner in everything
• Being my home
• Being you

Every moment with you is a gift. Every laugh, every challenge, every adventure - I treasure all of it.

Here's to many more years of:

• Late night conversations
• Stupid jokes that only we find funny
• Supporting each other's dreams
• Growing together

I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I'll love you even more tomorrow.

To us,

Read this slowly.

You are:

• The first thing on my mind when I wake up
• The last thing on my mind before I sleep
• And honestly, everything in between

I love you. Not a little. A lot. More than I can properly put into words.

If love could be tangible, I'd give you the entire ocean.

But since it can't, I hope these words are enough to show you how much you mean to me.

You are loved. You are wanted. You are enough.

Always remember that.

With all my heart,
